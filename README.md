# Breast Cancer Detection

## Introduction
Machine learning is widely recognized as the methodology of choice in Breast Cancer pattern classification and forecast modeling. The early diagnosis of breast cancer can improve the prognosis and chance of survival significantly, as it can promote timely clinical treatment to patients. Further accurate classification of benign tumors can prevent patients undergoing unnecessary treatments. Thus, the correct diagnosis of BC and classification of patients into malignant or benign groups is the subject of much research. Because of its unique advantages in critical features detection from complex cancer datasets, ML is widely recognized as the methodology of choice in breast cancer pattern classification and forecast modeling. Therefore, in this workshop, you'll learn how to detect breast cancer in patients in a supervised classification setting.
